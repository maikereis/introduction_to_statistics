    "## Data Snooping and the Multiple Testing Fallacy\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1992 a Swedish study examined whether living near a power line causes adverse health effects. It reported a statistically highly significant increase in childhood leukemia.\n",
    "\n",
    "A careful follow-up analysis failed to confirm this result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why did the study find a statistically significant result?\n",
    "\n",
    "The study looked at 800 different health effects:\n",
    "\n",
    "There were 800 statistical tests involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "A statistical test summarizes the evidence for an effect by reporting a p-value:\n",
    "\n",
    "A smaller p-value means stronger evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "p-value < 1% $\\rightarrow$ test is \"highly significant\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: if there is no effect, then there is only a 1% chance to get such a highly significant result.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we do 800 tests, then even if there is no effect at all we expect to see $800\\times 1\\% = 8$ highly significant results just by chance!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called the **multiple testing fallacy** or **look-elsewhere effect**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing large amounts of data it is easy to fall into this trap because there are so many potential relationships to explore, which leads to **data snooping (=data dredging)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reproducibility and Replicability\n",
    "\n",
    "Data snooping and other problems have lead to a crisis with regard to **replicability** (getting similar conclusions with different samples, procedures and data analysis methods) and **reproducibility** (getting the same results when using the same data and methods of analysis).\n",
