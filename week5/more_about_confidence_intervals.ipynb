    "The width of the confidence interval is determined by $zSE$, which is called the **margin of error**.<br>\n",
    "A larger sample size $n$ will result in a smaller margin of error since $SE=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$, but we need four times the sample size to cut the width in half.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also make the width smaller by making $z$ smaller, e.g. use a 80% confidence level instead of 95%. Then the price for more precision (i.e. shorter interval) is less confidence that it covers the parameter $\\mu$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an easy to remenber formula for a 95% confidence interval for a percentage:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$estimated{~}percentage \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That's because $\\sigma = \\sqrt{p(1-p)}  \\leqslant \\frac{1}{2}$ no matter what $p$ is.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is journalistic convention to use a 95% confidence level unless stated otherwise."
