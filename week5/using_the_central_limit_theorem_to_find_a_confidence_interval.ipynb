    "## Using the Central Limit Theorem to Find a Confidence Interval\n",
    "\n",
    "A confidence interval gives a range of plausible values for a population parameter $\\mu$. Usually the confidence interval is centered at an estimate for $\\mu$ which is an average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\mu$ = approval percentage among all 140 million likely voters. <br> estimate = approval percentage among voters in the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. $\\mu$ = speed of light.<br> estimate = average os 30 measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the central limit theorem applies for averages, the confidence interval has a simple form:\n",
    "$$estimate{~}\\pm{~}zSE$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $z$ is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level:\n",
    "\n",
    "95% confidence level $\\rightarrow z=1.96$<br>\n",
    "90% confidence level $\\rightarrow z=1.65$<br>\n",
    "99% confidence level $\\rightarrow z=2.58$\n",
    "\n",
    "SE is the standard error os the estimate. If the estimate is an average (e.g. a percentage), then we know that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$SE=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have a problem: we don't know $\\sigma$ because we don't know all the data in the population (that's the reason why we sample in the first place!)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **bootstrap principle** states that we can estimate $\\sigma$ by its sample version $s$ and still get an approximately correct confidence interval."
