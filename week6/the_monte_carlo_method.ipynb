    "What is the average height of all people living in the United States?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is difficult to determine exactly but can easily be estimated quite well:<br>\n",
    "Sample $n=100$ (say) people at random. Then use the average height of these $n$ people as an estimate of the average height of all people in the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of the general problem where we are interested in a unknown **parameter** $\\theta$ of a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "We estimate $\\theta$ with a statistic (**estimator**) $\\hat{\\theta}$ which is based on a sample of $n$ observations $X_1, ..., X_n$ drawn at random from the population:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{\\theta}=$ average of the sample $=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{\\theta}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i$ tends to be close to the uncomputable population mean $\\theta$, even for moderate sample sizes such as $n=100$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is a special case of the **Monte Carlo Method** or **Simulation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We approximate a fixed quantity $\\theta$ by the average of independent randdom variables that have expected value $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* By the law of large numbers, the approximation error can be made arbitrarily small by using a large enough sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Monte Carlo Method can also be used for more involved quantities. For example, we can use it to compute the standard error (SE) of a statistic $\\hat{\\theta}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recal that the standard error tells roughly how far off the statistic will be from its expected value. The precise definition is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$SE(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\sqrt{E(\\hat{\\theta} - E(\\hat{\\theta}))^2}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "* Compute $\\hat{\\theta}$ for each sample, resulting in 1,000 estimates $\\hat{\\theta}_1, ..., \\hat{\\theta}_{1000}$\n",
    "\n",

    "Note that this is not an average of independent random variables. But it can be shown that the law of large numbers still applies and Monte Carlo works:\n",
