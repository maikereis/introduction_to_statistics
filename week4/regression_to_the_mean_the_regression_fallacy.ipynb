    "## Regression to the Mean, The Regression Fallacy\n",
    "\n",
    "The main use of regression is to predict $y$ from $x$:<br>\n",
    "Given $x$, predict $y$ to be $\\hat{y}=a+bx$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction for $y$ at $x=\\tilde{x}$ is simply $\\hat{y}=\\tilde{y}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But $b=r\\frac{s_y}{s_x}$ means that if $x$ is one standar deviation ${s}_x$ above $\\tilde{x}$, then the predicted $\\hat{y}$ is only $rs_y$ above $\\tilde{y}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $r$ is between -1 and 1, the prediction is 'towars the mean': $\\hat{y}$ is fewer standard deviations away from $\\tilde{y}$ than $x$ is from $\\tilde{x}$"
